    Is there any insurance for the Sakthi safety lockers and for the things kept inside the lockers?Lockers are meant to provide anonymity and privacy. The primary purpose of lockers is safety. Part of the safety comes from the fact that nobody knows the content of the lockers. Sakthi safety lockers do not take insurance cover for the contents of the locker since customers do not disclose the contents. It is not possible to insure the contents without knowing the value of the contents. However, we can insure the contents of the locker on cost to customer basis provided the customer declares the contents and its value.
    Why are you not giving any interest on the rental advance? Are we not losing our interest?The returns for the organization have been worked out on the basis of the rentals charged plus the notional earnings on the advance rentals. If we were to pay interest on the advance then we would have to charge a higher rental to protect the organizationâ€™s returns.
